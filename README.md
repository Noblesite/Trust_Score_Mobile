# TrustScore Mobile - Concept Pitch

## Overview

I've been thinking about the current state of mobile app security in enterprise environments,and frankly, I don’t buy the illusion. Most solutions rely on VPN-based reverse proxies or shallow security theater. What if we approached mobile security differently?

**TrustScore Mobile** is a concept that flips the script. Instead of trying to "secure" the mobile OS (which is sandboxed and hardened by design), we tap into what's already deployed: MDMs. We leverage SDKs from leading MDM providers,starting with **Microsoft Intune**, to evaluate actual device posture and generate a **weighted trust score** that apps can use to make real-time security decisions.

## Why This Matters

Security isn’t about pretending to be a firewall inside an app. It's about understanding the context of the device: how it's managed, what compliance policies are enforced, whether it’s rooted, encrypted, or missing patches. We already have that data, MDMs are enforcing it,we just need to expose and use it.

## Core Idea

1. Embed MDM SDKs (starting with **Intune**, later Workspace ONE, MaaS360, etc.)
2. Pull posture data: root/jailbreak status, OS version, patch level, compliance flags
3. Assign weights to each posture signal to create a **Trust Score (0–100)**
4. Apps use that score to:
   - Block access
   - Trigger MFA
   - Restrict sensitive features
   - Log and report risk levels to the backend or SOC

## Sample Scoring Matrix

| Source       | Attribute                         | Weight | Notes                  |
|--------------|------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------|
| Intune SDK   | Jailbroken/Rooted                 | 5      | Critical risk          |
| Intune SDK   | OS Patch Compliance               | 3      | Moderate risk          |
| Intune SDK   | Device Encryption Enabled         | 2      | Required               |
| Intune SDK   | PIN/Biometric Configured          | 2      | Triggers MFA if absent |
| Intune SDK   | App Protection Policy Applied     | 4      | Major control signal   |
| Custom Input | Network Type (e.g., Public Wi-Fi) | 1      | Optional risk signal   |

Trust Score = normalized weighted total (scale: 0–100).

## MVP Goals (Q2 2025)
- [x] Intune SDK wrapper in native Swift
- [x] Local scoring engine with config file
- [ ] REST API backend to expose Trust Score
- [ ] Basic dashboard to view active posture stats

## Phase 2+ Features
- Workspace ONE + MaaS360 SDK support
- Splunk/WS1 Intelligence webhook integration
- Admin UI to manage scoring templates
- Step-up auth trigger integration
- Android parity (Google Play Integrity + MDMs)

## Final Thought

Most mobile security tools chase shadows. This concept chases signals. MDMs already know whether a device is trustworthy,we just need to make that trust quantifiable, usable, and visible to the app itself.

This approach respects the OS security model and makes app-layer security both meaningful and adaptable. Let's stop playing defense with VPN tunnels and start quantifying real posture instead.
